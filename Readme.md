# AVIATION RISK ANALYSIS
# OVERVIEW
The aviation industry continually seeks to have reliable operations with very low risk. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis for historical aviation accidents to understand their causes, offer practical insights to the company's head of aviation and guide the company on the best investment.


# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Our company seeks to venture into the aviation industry, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. Multiple companies in this industry make a decision based on cost, performance, or availability. However, without looking closely at safety records, there is a risk of selecting aircraft with poor accident histories. This can lead to higher risks, unexpected costs, and safety challenges in the long run. The problem we aim to solve is how to use accident data to analyze and compare safety levels across aircraft models, to make well informed decisions balancing both performance and risk

# Objectives
1. To explore and understand the aviation accident dataset.

2. To clean and prepare the data for analysis by addressing missing and inconsistent values.

3. Determine which aircraft has the lowest operational risk

# DATA 
The dataset we are using is from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and contains records of civil aviation accidents and selected incidents from 1948 to 2023. Each record provides details such as the date of the event, aircraft information, operator, location, injury severity, and probable cause.

The dataset is valuable because it allows us to analyze historical aviation accidents, identify trends, and assess risk factors across different types of aircraft. However, it also contains missing values and inconsistencies that must be handled during data cleaning before meaningful insights can be drawn.

# ANALYSIS

### Accidents over time
![image.png](attachment:image.png)

The sharp spike seen around 1982 does not represent an actual surge in accidents but is likely due to a change in reporting or data collection methods. What is more important is the clear downward trend from the mid-1980s to the present, showing continuous improvements in aviation safety. Advances in aircraft technology, stricter regulations, and better training have all contributed to reducing accidents, even as air traffic has increased. Overall, the long-term trend demonstrates that aviation is becoming progressively safer.

### Accidents per phase flight

Landing is a critical phase of flight, and pilots must exercise extra care. The graph shows that many accidents over the years have occurred due to incorrect or unsafe landings, highlighting the importance of proper technique and attention during this phase.

# Recommendation
Prioritize safer aircraft makes
Enhance on passanger safety
Exercise caution with high risk makes like Cessna, Boeing and Piper before use.
Emphasize pilot training majorly on landing as it is a critical phase.
Emphasize of safety procedures regulary
